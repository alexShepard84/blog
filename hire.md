TDD evangelist who loves programming clean code architecture.

I'm available as a freelance iOS engineer and always looking for new interesting challenges. <br />

You can hire me for: <br />

* Swift programming
* App architecture
* Scrum development
* Code review

I've worked with a lot of clients like:

* RTL Interactive GmbH
* Cologne Broadcasting Center GmbH
* addmore mobile GmbH
* Henkel Loctite
* Vodafone

Since Apple swift has released, I have been working with it. I love to work in Scrum teams and write code after writing tests,
because I think that this increases the software quality considerably. <br />

If you think that would be interesting to your team, app or company please contact me by sending an email to
<a.schaefer@app-concept.de> or add me on [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Alexander_Schaefer20).
